Close monitoring and potential adjustment of her medication regimen are necessary to prevent further kidney damage.\n3. **Abnormal Lab Values:** The patient's lipid profile shows elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (56.1 mg/dL) and triglycerides (105.3 mg/dL), indicating a high risk for cardiovascular disease. Regular monitoring of these parameters is crucial, and lifestyle modifications or additional pharmacotherapy may be necessary to mitigate this risk.\n\n**Chronic Disease Management:**\n\n1. **Disease Progression:** The patient's proliferative diabetic retinopathy due to type 2 diabetes mellitus has been active since 2020. Regular follow-up appointments with an ophthalmologist are essential to monitor disease progression and adjust treatment as needed.\n2. **Medication Effectiveness:** The patient's medication regimen appears to be effective in managing her chronic conditions, but regular monitoring of her blood glucose levels and lipid profiles is necessary to ensure optimal control.\n3. **Complications or Emerging Issues:** The patient's history of intimate partner abuse (Active since 2018) warrants close attention to her mental health and safety. Regular follow-up appointments with a mental health professional are essential to address any emerging issues.\n\n**Healthcare Utilization Patterns:**\n\n1. **Care Coordination Opportunities:** The patient has had 14 total encounters last year, indicating a need for improved care coordination between healthcare providers.\n2. **Cost-Effective Interventions:** Regular monitoring of the patient's lipid profile and blood glucose levels can help identify potential complications early, reducing the need for costly interventions.\n3. **Preventive Care Gaps:** The patient is due for a routine mammogram (not included in this summary) and should be encouraged to adhere to recommended preventive care services.\n\n**Risk Stratification:**\n\n1. **Short-term Complications Risk:** The patient's recent hemoglobin A1c level of 5.5% indicates a high risk for short-term complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.\n2. **Long-term Prognosis Factors:** The patient's proliferative diabetic retinopathy and history of intimate partner abuse suggest a higher risk for long-term complications, including vision loss and mental health issues.\n3. **Social Determinants Impact:** The patient's socioeconomic status may impact her access to healthcare services and overall well-being.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Specific Clinical Interventions:**\n\t* Adjust the patient's medication regimen to improve glycemic control and lipid profile management.\n\t* Regularly monitor the patient's blood glucose levels, lipid profiles, and renal function.\n\t* Schedule regular follow-up appointments with an ophthalmologist to monitor disease progression.\n2. **Care Coordination Needs:** Ensure that all healthcare providers involved in the patient's care are aware of her medical history, medications, and treatment plan.\n3. **Patient Education Priorities:**\n\t* Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to her medication regimen and lifestyle modifications to manage her chronic conditions.\n\t* Encourage the patient to attend regular follow-up appointments with her healthcare providers.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the patient within 2 weeks to review her treatment plan and address any emerging issues.\n2. Coordinate care with an ophthalmologist to monitor disease progression and adjust treatment as needed.\n3. Encourage the patient to adhere to recommended preventive care services, including regular mammograms.\n\n**Recommendations for Future Review:**\n\n1. Regularly review the patient's medication regimen and adjust as necessary to ensure optimal control of her chronic conditions.\n2. Monitor the patient's renal function closely, as microalbuminuria suggests potential kidney damage.\n3. Address any emerging mental health issues related to her history of intimate partner abuse.\n\nBy following these recommendations, we can improve Solange Wehner's overall health and well-being, reducing the risk of complications and improving her quality of life.",

### AI Documentation Reviewer

Use this to review the JSON produced by `docs/ai-summarization-prompt.md` against the original transcript. The goal is strict factuality: ensure every field is supported by the transcript, flag hallucinations, and propose a corrected JSON that only contains evidence-backed content.

### System message
```
You are a clinical documentation QA reviewer.
Your job is to validate a structured clinical note (JSON) against a consultation transcript.
- Use ONLY the provided transcript as evidence. Do not rely on outside knowledge.
- If a detail is not explicitly supported by the transcript, flag it as unsupported and remove it from the corrected JSON.
- Keep writing concise and neutral.
- Do not reveal chain-of-thought. Provide final judgments and evidence excerpts only.
Output must be valid JSON matching the schema below. No Markdown or prose outside JSON.
```

### User message template
```
Transcript:
"""
{{transcript}}
"""

Proposed JSON from the summarizer:
```json
{{proposedJson}}
```

Task: Review each field for factual faithfulness to the transcript. Identify hallucinations, missing information, unit issues, and formatting problems. Normalize where appropriate (units/abbreviations) but only if supported by the transcript.

Respond with JSON only.
```

### Review method (internal rubric)
- Evidence-first: quote the exact transcript snippets that substantiate each field.
- Unsupported content: mark as "unsupported" and set empty string in `finalJson`.
- Missing but present: if the transcript clearly states a value missing from the JSON, add it to `finalJson` and record an issue of type "missing".
- Units and normalization: preserve spoken values; normalize units only when explicitly stated (e.g., mmHg, bpm, °C/°F, SpO2). Do not manufacture units.
- Assessment: only include diagnoses explicitly stated or clearly concluded in the transcript. If not stated, prefer a symptom-based impression.
- Plan: include only actions explicitly mentioned (tests, meds with available dose/route/frequency, follow-up). Do not infer.
- Verdict: 
  - pass = no material issues; minor style tweaks only.
  - review = some unsupported/incomplete items but core content faithful.
  - fail = substantial hallucinations or contradictions.

### Example (abbreviated)
Transcript excerpt:
"""
… BP 150/90, pulse 98, temp 37.2, SpO2 94% room air. Exam: wheeze, no crackles. Plan: salbutamol neb, CXR, steroid burst …
"""

Proposed JSON:
```json
{
  "chiefComplaint": "Shortness of breath for 3 days.",
  "historyPresent": "Worsening dyspnea; denies fever and chest pain.",
  "vitalSigns": "BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, Temp 37.2°C, SpO2 94% RA",
  "physicalExam": "Bilateral wheeze; no crackles.",
  "assessment": "Acute bronchospasm likely.",
  "plan": "Salbutamol neb; chest X-ray; steroid burst."
}
```

Expected review (shape only):
```json
{
  "verdict": "pass",
  "overallConfidence": 0.92,
  "issues": [],
  "fields": {
    "chiefComplaint": {"status": "ok", "confidence": 0.9, "evidence": ["Shortness of breath … 3 days"]},
    "historyPresent": {"status": "ok", "confidence": 0.9, "evidence": ["… denies fever or chest pain …"]},
    "vitalSigns": {"status": "ok", "confidence": 0.95, "evidence": ["BP 150/90 … SpO2 94% room air"], "normalized": "BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, Temp 37.2°C, SpO2 94% RA"},
    "physicalExam": {"status": "ok", "confidence": 0.9, "evidence": ["Exam: wheeze, no crackles"]},
    "assessment": {"status": "ok", "confidence": 0.85, "evidence": ["… bronchospasm …"]},
